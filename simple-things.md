# Doing Simple Things
Simple things are always the hardest to achieve. 

I'm writing this on a new year. When you go for a run, there's no difference between Mile 1, Mile 15 or Mile 21. But how you perceive it is very different. How your body reacts to it is very different. I think of New Years in the same way. While today is no different than any other day in the year, a New Year gives you an option to reset, take stock and replan. 

When I think about how I want to conduct myself, as I often do, I realize that all the ingredients to lead a successful life are very simple. They're the absolute basics, grounded. You want to be physically healthy, just work out for 10 mins a day. Want to excel at work, understand the basics, ask questions and think from first principles. Want to have a healthy relationship, learn to listen. 

I have thought about this simplicity principle for a long time and the more I spend time on this, the more I'm convinced about it. 

While these principles are simple, they are hard to achieve in practice. It's not easy to even spend 10 minutes working out every day, hard to listen in a relationship and so on. At least for me, and based on my observation, for a lot of people around me. 

## So how do we achieve this?
The approach I have taken is to be honest with myself. When I sacrifice on my daily habits, I know I'm convincing myself with an excuse. I've made it a point to not give an excuse to myself. It does not always work but I get back to it. It has taken me years but I've become more productive and more diligent in my habits over the years. 

The second approach is to shock the system. I learnt this concept from the book - What you do is who you are by Ben Horowitz. If you want to change the current culture, you need to provide a shock to the system that is higher than the network strength. Meaning, if you are trying to remove an incumbent habit that is highly entrenched, you can only remove that habit by shocking yourself with a much higher intensity habit. For eg., I love writing but I hate writing on social media. But when I run ZORP, I have to write on social media. The only way I could do this by freezing my 9-10 AM only to write the content. I made myself sit idle if I can't write. Sitting idle is too much of a shock to my system that I ended up writing a post a day. 

Once you have the ability to do these simple things diligently, you will be unstoppable. If you're the most curious, driven person who can think in first principles, you will absolutely succeed in your career. There is absolutely no chance that you are going to fail. Even with this knowledge, almost everyone ignores this and goes after comfort than quality. 

That is the focus for 2025. Do the simple things really well.
