Here are some of the books I've read and liked. Not in any particular order.

#### [Caste In India Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development](https://www.amazon.in/dp/8193600894) - By Dr. B.R.Ambedkar.
I'm fascinated with caste in India. This is a wonderful foundation. 

#### [Parkistan or the Partition of India](https://www.amazon.in/Untouchables-Constitution-understanding-Autobiography-Annihilation/dp/935220526X) - By Dr. B.R.Ambedkar. 
One of the best books I've every read. A hard read. The fact that this was written in 1945 about the upcoming partition makes it even more amazing.

#### [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.in/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0099590085) - Yuval Noah Harari
I like books that provide you frameworks to understand the world. This book is a good foundation for deeper exploration.

#### [The Arabs](https://www.amazon.in/Arabs-Eugene-Rogan/dp/0141986549/ref=sr_1_1) - Eugene Rogan
We unfortunately, see the world through our experience. I have long tried to understand the Arab world. This book is an eye-opener. 

#### [Hard things about hard things](https://www.amazon.in/dp/6158551120/ref=sr_1_1_sspa) - Ben Horowitz
My go to book for work. No bullshit guide to starting a company. 

#### [Anarchy](https://www.amazon.in/Anarchy-Company-Corporate-Violence-Pillage/dp/1526656523/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1) - Willian Dalrymple
I've been reading India's history. This is a good guide to understand the how EIC took over India.

#### [Shoe Dog](https://www.amazon.in/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-NIKE/dp/1471146723/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1) - Phil Knight
Best biography ever!
