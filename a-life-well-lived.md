I've often thought about what it means to live well. This is mainly for me. When I am dying and look back on my life, what would make me smile?

Here's a short list:
1. Wake up next to someone whom you want kiss, every day.
2. Go for a walk among nature in the middle of the day.
3. Go to the airport and take a flight to anyplace on earth without a second thought.
4. Have a friend to drink with on a Saturday night.
5. At least 10 people you could call at 12 AM if you need anything.
6. Make a random stranger's life better through your action.
7. Have a 100 people to listen to what you have to say.
