I saw how rituals around death are set up to make the grieving easier.

Created on: 5th October

Very recently, I had someone very close to me pass away. This is the death that's personal to me so far in my life. During the rituals around these events, I've noticed certain under currents. The entire set of rituals were built around making the family comfortable. We'll talk about that here. 

Some background before we start:
I was born in a village of a few hundred people. I, most of my relatives and neighbours belong to this single community called the Kongu Vellala Gounders. As I understand we were (and still are to a large extent) largely farm owners with a long history, which we will get into some other day. When I was as little as 6, we migrated to a nearby town. I also stayed in boarding school and college most of my life. So, my exposure to the community is limited. 

That's why I find this very fascinating. Before we get into the event itself, it's important to understand how this community is structured. Everyone is related one way or the other. Even if you're not, you're usually assigned a relationship. There are two buckets of relatives one has. 
Brothers: The people who belong to your exact sub caste or cousins who form a parallel male lineage. You can't marry them. 
Uncles: These are lineages whom you call uncle and aunt and people you can marry. 
There's a straightforward way of figuring this out, but something I don't want to get into right now. Remember these, we'll reference them.

Let's get to the day of the event. 
### Announcement
Say someone passes away in your family, the first thing you do is inform a handful of relatives. It ends there. You are not expected to tell everyone you know. It's the responsiblity of those handful of people to inform everyone in their circle so everyone relevant gets to know. 

After informing them, you literally do not have to do anything as the grieving family. 

### Preparations
Now, the body is brought to the home (usually). I literally saw 100s of people show up in the next hour. And temporary structures, seating, water, tea, and more are set up by relatives. They coordinate among themselves and set up everything. 
The women are huddled up separately. They meet the women of the household and start crying. Most of this crying is fake. They instantly start crying when they see the women of the household and in less than a minute, become normal. 
The men sit outside and several men run around busy taking care of arrangements. The men of the household, simply receive people who show up to pay their respects.

### Paying respects
A lot of people start showing up. When their enter the location, they usually go to the immediate family who is affected. The immediate family includes people who live in the family and the "Brother relatives" who are closer to the family. The family members open both their palms facing up with a white towel in their hand. The people who come in face their palms down with a white towel and both the palm tips touch each other. It's a way of them saying "I take part in your sorrow".

After this, the women who are closer to the family usually huddle and cry. Others simply pray. The men just pray. The women occasionally huddle around the body and sing in a very sorrowful song format. It's called "Oppari". It's a song type that revolves around crying. It was haunting and sorrow. 

If you notice, the women of the household end up crying 10s of times that night. This process is design in a way that they let out their emotions instead of bottling them up. 

Another thing the visitors do is ask the question "What happened?". It's asked by EVERYONE! The family is forced to repeat the entire story 100s of times that day. Even if people don't know what to say to console, this one question forces the family to talk out loud what has happened. By the end of the night, the family has spoken out so many times what happened that **the event is normalized in their heads**. 

### Staying the night
At times, the body is taken right away for the funeral pyre. Sometimes, it's kept overnight at home. 
When the body is kept overnight, there will always be some people close to the family who stay the night. And there will at least be one person who is awake. And usually there's loud music going on. 
Again, there are reasons for this. 
- This is because in the olden days, there was no electricity. And they live in small villages surrounded by forests.
- The light, the loud noise and people awake makes sure animals do not disturb the body during the night.

### The funeral pyre
I do not fully understand the reason behind the rituals here, so I'll just share what I saw. 
- For the dad, the youngest son in the family (and if there are no sons, the closest "brother relative") does the process
- For the mom, the eldest son does the same.

The body was taken in the van followed by a lot of men. Nowadays women also go but it was usually men. They visit the graveyard. The other people who visit the graveyard are usually close to the family and it's considered a great respect if you be there. The son usually shaves his head, showers and they go around the body led by the uncle relative carrying a pot with water over their right shoulder. They take 3 rounds while someone from behind makes a hole in the pot for every round. Finally the pot is broken. I assume this is a way to send the soul to the other world. Have to learn more about this. 

After this, the body was taken to the electric burner (there's one in every town now) and the body is burnt after some prayers. 

### Back home
Once the son comes back home along with the relatives. There was a series of things done with showering the son again outside the home. There were poojas done. He wears new clothes offered by the uncle side of relatives.
Note: The family simply follows what they are told. They don't have to purchase clothes or coordinate anything. 
Then, they made 4 types of food: Curd rice, sambar rice, chicken rice and mutton rice. All the relatives, threw 3 scoops of rice to the roof. It's considered food for the deceased. I think they expect them to appear as crows.

### The women
If the person who died was a husband, there are some rituals for the wife. 
I saw that the brother of the wife (or an uncle relative of the main family) gets white saree and a few other things for the wife. They also brought a big bunch of cooking stuff like oil, rice, pulses etc.
There was a process where the wife was clothed with a white saree. She started crying. She was given a needle and 3 pieces of cotton and the people around sang a song. 
It went something like this: "Don't worry that your husband is not there to provide. You're given cotton and needle, you can weave and survive". 

The idea here is that the uncle side comforts the woman of the house that there is enough stuff to cook food and wear clothes that she does not have to worry. She can continue her grief. 

They also gave her a few freshly bought clothes. 

### The food
During this entire time, everyone who reaches the place is offered food, water and tea. Again, arranged by the relatives. They were issued either in the temporary structures or nearby homes (which was so nice to see). 
But the immediate family was not allowed to the leave the house. The food is brought to them. So they do not have to worry about going out. 

### The next few days
A few things happened over the next few days. 
1. The people close to the family stayed for 3 days. This is to make sure that the grieving family does not feel alone. They have their immediate relatives around them. They are literally not left alone for a second.
2. Even after 3 days, the same relatives came as often as daily to simply spend time with the family. 
3. More and more people came. People who couldn't come on the first day kept coming for the next 15 days. And they all asked the question "What happened?". By the 4th day, the family was largely out of the immediate shocks and burdens. The grief was still there but the pain had subsided.
4. The family was not allowed to the leave the house for x number of days. The x depends on the time of death and how auspicious it is. And until then, the family is not allowed to cook at home and they are brought food by the relatives. And on the last day, the family is allowed to go out to a relatives house to end the "House arrest" who feed them and cloth them and bring them back. After this, the family can start cooking.
5. There were some other gifting and reverse gifting and a lot of small stuff to make sure every one in the family is content.

### The money
All these arrangements come at a cost. The actual family was the one who paid (more like reimbursed) at the end. Which makes sense. 

Earlier, I always thought why the immediate family is not left alone to grieve. I would always get stuck on what to say to someone who had a loss. And my instinct was not to disturb them. These experiences have completely changed my mind. I do not know if the experiences are similar in other cultures but this one impressed on me what having a good community means to someone who needs help.
