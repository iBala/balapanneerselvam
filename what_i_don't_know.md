# What I don't know
We often take simple things for granted. The more exposure I get, the more I fail to understand what I've been taught and learnt. 
I add things here when I want to learn about them. I write about my learnings once I've changed my mind enough.


## History
### Why is caste so prevalent in India?
I don't see the same replication in other societies. There are class divisions and race divisions. But class introduces a terrifying landscape where people who are more similar to each other are persecuted in the name of culture.

I've written about this here: [Caste in India](https://ibala.github.io/balapanneerselvam/#caste-in-india)

### The Irish/Welsh/Scottish history
How do they see themselves and how have they interacted with each other over centuries?

### Divisions of Islam
History of Islam and the sects

### Vegeterianism in India
A large part of Indian population is vegetarian. Why? It's not for animal welfare. 

### Rise of Hinduism & how's Kashmir involved
Read about this account but I don't remember the history. Would love to read more. 

### Life of a common man in ancient India
We glorify kings and rulers. I want to read about how life was for a common man. 

## Technology
### How does a Pressure cooker work?
Seems like a great piece of innovation.
