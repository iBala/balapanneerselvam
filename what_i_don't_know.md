# What I don't know
We often take simple things for granted. The more exposure I get, the more I fail to understand what I've been taught and learnt. 
I add things here when I want to learn about them. I write about my learnings once I've changed my mind enough.


## History
### Why is caste so prevalent in India?
I don't see the same replication in other societies. There are class divisions and race divisions. But class introduces a terrifying landscape where people who are more similar to each other are persecuted in the name of culture.

I've written about this here: [Caste in India](https://ibala.github.io/balapanneerselvam/#caste-in-india)

### The Irish/Welsh/Scottish history
How do they see themselves and how have they interacted with each other over centuries?

### Divisions of Islam
History of Islam and the sects

### Vegeterianism in India
A large part of Indian population is vegetarian. Why? It's not for animal welfare. 

### Rise of Hinduism & how's Kashmir involved
Read about this account but I don't remember the history. Would love to read more. 

### Life of a common man in ancient India
We glorify kings and rulers. I want to read about how life was for a common man. 

### Theory that movement from Hunter-Gatherer to Settle-down-agriculture is the result of all the class and economic divides.
I came across this in [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.in/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0099590085?crid=1O3SXRIXGOGCV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0B00y93QZKlEi8Jm-KlML_M8mJoZEmtWqb1IkbEhPkHLYH-iqNMU4e01qc5dCvj9gjB9Gu2Wky2MHB3qKJ6p3lKhQZqA1g_8_Py6kumFy6JHExIX8LernIKVCCkO_o5L0W-N3xJYCE243UY-hE4ystJs65jNWemI4K1f6EuEweYMuxdTPA5VZvxAbmAr1DBJLoWJDLbtxo76UwWKQT94LF_BPuLeGS9jV6cy7v2EtxI.Wg-quFS-12oU6V1dbazlzL3LURC5vlKglsJjeLsMq3I&dib_tag=se&keywords=sapiens&qid=1730792798&sprefix=sapien,aps,369&sr=8-3). Too simplistic a way of summarizing 10000 years of history. 

## Technology
### How does a Pressure cooker work?
Seems like a great piece of innovation.
