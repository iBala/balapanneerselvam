# What I don't know
We often take simple things for granted. The more exposure I get, the more I fail to understand what I've been taught and learnt. 
I add things here when I want to learn about them. I write about my learnings once I've changed my mind enough.

I don't see the same replication in other societies. There are class divisions and race divisions. But class introduces a terrifying landscape where people who are more similar to each other are persecuted in the name of culture.
I've written about this here: [Caste in India](https://ibala.github.io/balapanneerselvam/#caste-in-india) |
