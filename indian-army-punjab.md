# Why Punjabis have (or had) a major representation in the Indian army

Historically, Punjabis have had a major representation in the Indian Army. As I understood growing up, this was because of them being a warrior race in general. This is not just myth but in 1879, a document has been put forth by the British detailing different classes of people in India and segregating them in terms of martial and non-martial class.

What I've learnt recently has brought into question some of those beliefs. 

My thought process has changed mainly after reading [Parkistan or the Partition of India](https://www.amazon.in/Untouchables-Constitution-understanding-Autobiography-Annihilation/dp/935220526X?crid=2W6WCQKZ8BKG4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MXKebExrHDJeGOWLJiKRU3XgfFYYIQNjVv-EcmQ3CIC8JIQlmVJQAbvvanRJ_HTY1l3kCc0R82NRTJ5D37tYuYVOBFArf8nWFw0Q-OslDBpBdih3SjVyuJruHnfmkRZm8cMbL54zIwzeeQsEl64qRD-ss4E71FZhpvu6Ey0Nm9TIjsWn1DbqmkA7MwmxMMtLDB7_pdU83y3Z56Lzp3x-8fjGvXD6I9kKyIXld7rOMEU.mxYtz2ZW9W2Fqpg3FjHYDZNvpZfGoEXwxkwZf-HcL5U&dib_tag=se&keywords=pakistan+or+the+partition+of+india&qid=1730702340&sprefix=pakistan+or+the+p,aps,256&sr=8-3) by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.

## Some data to start with. 
1856 - less than 10% North west India*, >90% North East+Bengal+Bihar
1858 - 47% North West India, 47% North East+Bengal+Bihar
1930 - 58.5% North West India, 11% North East+Bengal+Bihar

A very obvious fact the data represents is that the Indian Army composition has significantly changed post 1857 mutiny. And the proportion of North West men in the Indian army has only grown after that. 

There are a few interesting factors here: 
1. Post the mutiny, which originated from the Bengal army, the British favoured the Punjab troops and tried to reduce Bengal troops. 
2. This does not mean that the interest to join the army was mainly with the Punjab men but the selection process ensured that the Punjab men get hired. 
3. After decades of rejection, the East and South Indian men have lower inclination of applying for the job which increases the proportion of Punjab troops. 
4. Looking at it from the lens of a Punjabi family, it becomes kind of a job for the population. You see everyone from your community joining the army and growing, so it reinforces more Punjabis to join the army. Military participation provides land grants and economic upliftment.
5. This fact was further reinforced in 1879 where the Martila vs Non-Martial class was put forth as a document by the British reinforcing their previous decision of making Punjabis the elite martial class of India. 

It's as good as saying that people in SF are the only great programmers in the world. 


*North West here means Punjab, NWFP and part of UP.
