# I changed my mind on caste system in India
I've been interested in learning about caste in India for about 2 years now. While the class system is universal in every society, caste system seemed to be unique to India. But India is not a common entity, we have different cultures, languages, and behaviors. I've been trying to read more about it. I think I've come to a place that my existing notions are being broken that it's time to put this on paper. 

The big trigger for writing this came from me watching the Tamil movie [Kottukali(The adamant girl)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27080561/).
Most of the content influence came from this amazing book by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar [Caste In India Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development](https://www.amazon.in/dp/8193600894)

## My personal dealings with caste
Here are a few (of many) personal experiences with caste.

### Traditional servitude
Since I was a kid, there's a lady who comes for work at my home. She's older than my dad but still everyone calls her by her name. She apparently used to work in our farm and still continues to come to our home to work for us (paid work). She's not the only one we can hire. She doesn't live close to us. We haven't owned a farm in decades. 
The thing is that she, her husband and their previous generations have been working for my family (apparently) over generations. They considered my grandparents their masters going multiple generations. 
She's not allowed to come inside the house, the plates she uses for food is kept separately (permanently). 

> I used to think until very recently that India didn't have slavery. 
- Something I have changed my mind on.

A good note: This ended with my grandparents' generation. Her sons and grandsons are (very fortunately) not part of this abhorrent system.

*Personal Note: Hard to believe this did not register in my mind for a lot of years.*

### Being treated differently
One of my best friends is a Brahmin by caste. Actually a lot of them are. We are really close even to this day. 
I had a subtle episode when I visited his house once that shook me a little. 
I was offered a sweet and once I'm done, the plate was taken to outside the house for cleaning. This was in the 2010s, not so long ago. I've never experienced this and offended me quite a bit. 

My anti-confrontational being did not pick up the topic and I silently left the house. We still catch up outside his house as friends. 
I've been lucky enough to have not experienced similar situations. But I'm sure this happens to plenty of folks. 

## Definition of Caste
The best explanation of this is found in Dr Ambedkar's book above which states that caste is a community that prohibits marriages outside their social community. This forms the genesis of caste. 

Why does it work?
- Prohibit marriage -> you reduce interactions -> Further implement additional constraints like Servitude, untouchability, restricted access etc. 
- Also, no one can get access to the caste group except by birth. 

## The abuses created by the caste system
### Restricting women
Here, we will see some of the abuses created by the caste system in the society and how it is due to the marriage prohibition. 

[Sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(practice)): A woman jumping into the funeral pyre of her husband. A community enforcing endogenous marriage will (over a period of time) settle around equal men & women. If a women loses her husband, and does not get great prospect in the community, a good way to avoid her moving to an outside community is burning her at the funeral pyre. 

Vidhva Dharma: When Sati became difficult to practice, an alternative to prevent widows from pursuing exogamous relations was to make them unappealing. This involved shaving their heads, removing jewelry, covering their heads, wearing plain clothes, and prohibiting ornaments like flowers.

Child marriage: A woman's attraction to other men comes in after she becomes active. If she can be tied to someone within the same community before she reaches sexual maturity, you can again control who she marries. So get her married when she's 6.

What about men?
Something I want to read more but the general sense is that men (who are the ones setting up these rules), do not want to apply the same restrictions for them. They went about solving this problem for them by remarrying younger women.

### Creating Social Hierarchy
When one class closes its doors to ensure caste purity, neighboring classes lose access to it. To avoid dilution, they close their doors to others. This percolates to multiple levels, inevitably creating a social hierarchy.

### Codifying social hierarchy
Once such a system is in place, you will start getting justifications on why the elite castes are elite and vice versa in the form of morally abusive text like [Manusmriti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusmriti).

Few disturbing tidbits from Manusmriti: 
- If a lower caste member accidentally hears vedas being read by a Brahmin, it recommends poring hot wax as a punishment into the lower caste member's ears.
- If a Brahmin is walking towards you, the low caste member should move out of the road and stand at the side so his shadow does not fall on the Brahmin.

Untouchability: I remember this being practiced when I was a kid. My aunt used to tell me that we can't touch certain being because they are of a lower caste. This is as recent as late 1990s. I'm sure a form of this stil continues in several parts of India.

## Closing thoughts
I have a lot more in common with my neighbours, in terms of my custom, religion, language, eating habits, skin color and more. We created an arbitrary system of an artificial hierarchy that has led to centuries of injustice in the country. Recognizing and understanding this system is the first step towards dismantling it and creating a more equitable society. 
It's not just a measure of favouring others, it's the way to collaborate and grow as a country.
